## Summary

This is a recreation of my expense tracker that was done with vanilla Javascript. The big difference here is that I used the React library in this application.

To use it, just fill in each of the fields and hit enter or click submit. The expenses will appear in a list below and will be sorted in decending order by date (with most recent date at the top). You can click the red "X" button to delete the expense. Expenses that weren't deleted will also be saved to local storage so you can pick back up where you left off at a later time!

The application took approximately 5 days to create. This was, at the time of this publishing, my most in-depth application using React. In writing this I was able to see how React can really simplify writing a program but also it helped give me a better understanding of how things work from an underlying perspective. Throughout this app I was also able to see the lifecycles in action.
